<h1>Sticky Notes App using ReactJS</h1>

<p>This is code for a basic notes app that uses React.  It will be modified at some point and I will notate where I make changes as I make the modifications.</p>

<ol>
    <li>Type npm install in terminal to install/add the packages in the package.json file.</li>
    <li>To run the app type npm start OR yarn start in the terminal.</li>
    <li>If you see something that needs tweaking please feel free to let me know</li>
</ol>

<p>Keep coding and have fun with it!!</p>

<p>Reminder this was initially constructed with typing <i>npx create-react-app my-app</i> into the terminal.  Replacing my-app with the name of YOUR app</p>
